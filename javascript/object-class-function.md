# Object Function and classes

Classes are new in ES2015. When you print them to the console you might notice that they display as `[Function: ClassName]`:

```js
{ lang:
   { SCLang: { [Function: SCLang] boot: [Function: boot] },
     boot: [Function: boot] }
```

And a what SuperCollider would call a Dictionary (or Event) is in JavaScript called an Object:

```js
{
  layer: { middleware: [Object], classes: [Object] }
}
```
